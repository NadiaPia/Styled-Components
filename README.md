# Getting Started with Create React App

The tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02zO0hZmwnw&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) explains how to use Styled Componets approach.
"Using tagged template literals and arrow functions in ES6+ and CSS, styled-components is a React-specific CSS-in-JS styling solution that creates a platform for developers to write actual CSS code to style React components, as well as in React Native.

Using styled-components makes it simple to use CSS to style components by writing JavaScript code. These components are known as “styled components” which are, in actuality, a React component with styles."
